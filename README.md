This is the next evolution of shortline. The goal of this app is for it to be turned into a children game where they can direct their trains to certain areas and interact with them. Like filling you engine up at a water tower.

The piece that will be most interesting for me, is that I want to connect 2+ sessions, so that children and create their worlds together

I am very excited about this one, and hope to have a true demo soon
